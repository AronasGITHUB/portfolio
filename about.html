			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p style="text-align:left;">My name is Aronas. I am a 10 year old programmer (yes, its true) who is based on Lithuania and I am a web developer and use the terminal. I believe i am a junior front-end developer and has learned technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.</p>

			<p style="text-align:left;">My dream job was to become a programmer, and i am learning to be one. I say that programming is not only a job, but also fun, with your freedom and imagination to create anything.</p>

		<h2>What makes me unique?</h2>
		<p>My approach to web development and design is driven by a balance of creativity, efficiency, and readable code. 
		<br> I focus on creating designs that are visually appealing and intuitive, aiming for simplicity and minimalism while ensuring they work seamlessly for the user. 
		<br> I believe that if a design looks great to me, it’s likely to resonate with others as well.
		<br>	To me, a project isn’t complete until both the aesthetics and functionality align in a way that feels natural.</p>
		<p>I sometimes prototype my designs using Figma, but I also find value in sketching ideas out on paper.
		<br>	This process allows me to quickly experiment with layout, structure, and flow before committing to code.
		<br>	While my design process is flexible and not bound by strict patterns, I aim to find solutions that both look great to me and are intuitive for others to use.</p>
		<p>When it comes to coding, I place a strong emphasis on clean, readable code.
		<br>	I believe that well-written code is just as important as the design itself, as it ensures future maintainability and scalability.
		<br>	While I sometimes find debugging a challenge, I also enjoy the process—it’s a chance to learn, improve, and solve problems in a way that brings a sense of accomplishment.</p>
		<p> In terms of collaboration, I’m always happy to lend a hand or contribute to a project when needed. 
		<br>	While I typically work solo, I’m open to sharing knowledge and helping others whenever the opportunity arises. </p>
		<p>The most rewarding part of my work comes when a project is complete, users enjoy interacting with it, and it looks as amazing as I imagined.
		<br>	There’s a unique satisfaction in seeing the final result and knowing it has made a positive impact.</p>

		<h2>My Values or Philosophy</h2>
		<p>At the heart of my work is the joy of creating something great.
		<br>	I find fulfillment not just in the process, but also in the end result—whether it’s a beautifully designed website or the satisfaction of finally solving a challenging bug.
		<br>	The thrill of completing a project and achieving my goals is one of the most rewarding aspects of what I do.</p>	
		<p>Learning is a major part of my philosophy.
		<br>	I take the time to fully understand each technology I work with before moving on to the next one. <br> I focus on mastering a technology first, getting really good at it, and only then exploring the next one.
		<br>	This approach helps me build a strong foundation and ensures that I’m applying my skills to their fullest potential.
		<br>	Whether it's through watching tutorials, taking courses, or diving deep into documentation, I’m committed to growing my expertise one step at a time.

</p>
		<p>User experience (UX) is a priority in my work.
		<br>	I believe that a successful project should always be intuitive and easy to use.
		<br>	I put a lot of thought into how users interact with what I build, ensuring that every decision I make serves to enhance the user’s experience.</p>
		<p>When it comes to balancing deadlines and quality, I aim for perfection or great enough.
		<br>	I trust my instincts to know when a project is ready to launch.
		<br>	Once everything is in place and I’m satisfied with the quality, I set it live with confidence, knowing that I’ve done my best.</p>
		<p>For me, success is defined by the completion of a project and achieving my goals along the way.
		<br>	Whether it’s seeing a project come to life or reaching a milestone in my learning journey, success is the feeling of progress and accomplishment.</p>

		<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
		<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me relax and stay inspired.
		<br> One of my favorite pastimes is playing board games, especially classics like chess and Stratego.
		<br> I love the strategy, critical thinking, and friendly competition these games provide.
		<br> I’m also an occasional gamer, with Minecraft being a go-to for unwinding and exploring creativity in a virtual world.</p>
		<p>Travel is another passion of mine. Last time I ventured outside of family visits, I had the chance to visit Gdańsk, Poland, a city rich in history and culture.
		<br> I find that travelling not only helps me recharge but also broadens my perspective and gives me fresh ideas for my work and personal growth.</p>
		<p>When it comes to work-life balance, my routine is fairly simple: I wake up, have breakfast, go to school, and dive straight into coding.
		<br> After a focused day of work, I make sure to rest and recharge.
		<br> I find that this straightforward approach helps me stay productive and energized for the challenges ahead.</p>
		<p>One of my future aspirations is to build a search engine called "SearchLite."
		<br> It’s a project I hope to bring to life one day as a fun, personal challenge.
		<br> While it's still in the idea phase, it’s something that keeps me motivated and excited about the possibilities of what I could create in the future.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, my interests outside of coding help me maintain a healthy balance, keep my mind sharp, and inspire me to continue learning and building.</p>

		<h2>Mission Statement and Goals</h2>
		<p>My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer, mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.
		<br> Once I reach that milestone, I’ll have the freedom to dive into any other technologies that excite me, expanding my skillset in whatever direction sparks my interest.
		<br> For now, I’m focused on becoming proficient with the languages and tools that will enable me to build powerful, end-to-end solutions for users.</p>
		<p>While my dream job has always been to be a programmer, I envision myself working from home and collaborating with clients remotely.
		<br> As I am currently under 18, I am unable to accept permanent job offers at the moment.
		<br> However, I’m open to collaborating on personal projects or offering my skills for freelance work where possible, with the understanding that I am still in the process of learning and developing my craft.</p>
		<p>I’m particularly excited for the bigger technologies that lie ahead—whether it's mastering advanced frameworks, exploring new areas of web development, or diving into emerging tech.
		<br>The possibilities are endless, and I’m eager to continue learning and growing.</p>
		<p>One of my personal projects I’m working toward is SearchLite—a search engine I hope to create someday.  <br> It’s a passion project that I’m determined to bring to life, and it represents the kind of innovation I aim to pursue in the future.</p>
		<p>As I continue to grow as a developer, my focus will always be on learning new technologies and expanding my capabilities.
		<br> I’m excited to evolve into a versatile developer, capable of tackling a variety of challenges across different domains.</p>
